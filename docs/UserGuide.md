## Introduction

TechToday Information Tracker(TTIT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing information about technology including news, jobs or even notes*. TTIT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI).
TTIT utilizes [Hacker News](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) API to give the user the option to **view** new news articles and questions/jobs. If the device is not connected to the internet, the user can **view** pre-loaded articles and jobs. The user also has the option to add interesting articles, jobs, questions, notes about technology themselves using the **create** functionality. 

## Quick Start

*  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
*  Download the latest `tp.jar` [latest reslease here!](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).
*  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Technology Information tracker.
*  Go to the directory where the Jar file is stored and type: `java -jar tp.jar`
* When the application executes, all possible commands that can help you manage your information are shown.
*Some example commands you can try:
    * **`view `**`article` : helps you view articles about technolgy from the internet. If the device is not connected to the internet, it loads an existing set of articles pre-loaded into the program.
    * **`list `**`article`: Lists all the articles you have saved in your database into the Command Line.
    * **`delete `**` article 1` : deletes the 1st artile that appears in the article list.
    * **`exit`** : exits the app.
